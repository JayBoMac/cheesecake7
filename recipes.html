<h2>SNICKERS CHEESECAKE</h2>

Yield: 16 to 20 servings
Prep Time: 25 minutes  Cook: 5 hours 35 minutes   

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>

<h4>For the crust:</h4>

<p>30 (1-15.35 ounce package) standard Oreo cookies (NOT double-stuffed)</p>
<p>6 tablespoons butter, melted</p>

<h4>For the cheesecake filling:</h4>

<p>32 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</p>
<p>5 large eggs</p>
<p>1 1/2 cups lightly packed light brown sugar</p>
<p>1/2 cup heavy cream</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p>18 fun-size Snickers bars (1-11.8 ounce package), coarsely chopped</p>

<h4>For the topping:</h4>

<p>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</p>
<p>1/2 cup heavy cream</p>
<p>9 fun-size Snickers bars, coarsely chopped</p>

<h4>Directions</h4>

<h4>For the crust:</h4>

<p>Preheat the oven to 325°F. In the bowl of a food processor, process the cookies until they are finely ground crumbs. Add the butter and pulse until moistened. Press into the bottom and halfway up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool.
For the filling:

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth. Add in the sugar, cream, and vanilla and beat until combined. Be careful not to overbeat. Stir in the Snickers bars.
Pour the batter into the cooled crust. Bake for about 1 hour, or until set and the top looks slightly dry. If the middle is slightly wobbly, that’s fine. Err on the side of underbaking rather than overbaking. Cool the cheesecake completely on a wire rack. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 4 hours. Release the cheesecake from the pan onto a cake stand or serving plate.</p>

<h4>For the topping:</h4>

<p>Place the chocolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan heat the cream just until simmering. Pour over the chocolate chips. Let sit for 3 minutes before stirring until the mixture is melted and smooth. Pour over the cheesecake, allowing to drip down the sides. Sprinkle the Snickers over the cheesecake. Serve or cover and store in the fridge for up to 2 days.</p>
